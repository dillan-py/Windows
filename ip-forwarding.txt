#CVE-1999-0511

IP Forwarding Enabled
Description
The remote host has IP forwarding enabled. An attacker can exploit this to route packets through the host and potentially bypass some firewalls / routers / NAC filtering.

Unless the remote host is a router, it is recommended that you disable IP forwarding.
Solution
On Linux, you can disable IP forwarding by doing :

echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

On Windows, set the key 'IPEnableRouter' to 0 under

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters

On Mac OS X, you can disable IP forwarding by executing the command :

sysctl -w net.inet.ip.forwarding=0

For other systems, check with your vendor.

Alternatively, you can set it via Command Prompt (as Administrator):

reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters /v IPEnableRouter /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
